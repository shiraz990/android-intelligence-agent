🤖 Android Intelligence Agent

An AI-powered Android project analysis tool that combines static analysis, rule-based code inspection, health scoring, and local Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate professional Android engineering reviews.

Built with Python, Streamlit, Ollama, and Qwen2.5-Coder.

✨ Features
📂 Scan Android projects automatically
📊 Calculate an Android Health Score
🏗 Analyze Android project architecture
🔍 Detect Android technologies (Compose, Hilt, Room, Retrofit, etc.)
🛡 Perform rule-based quality and security checks
🤖 Generate AI-powered engineering reviews
🔒 Analyze projects locally using Ollama (no cloud API required)
